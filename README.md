Uzebox Kickstart
================

Uzebox-Kickstart is arguably the ultimate fake retro computer emulator available for the Uzebox! You can run Uzebox-Kickstart on your fave open source console to fool your friends and family into thinking you've got an Amiga emulator on your Uzebox that you've just not configured properly yet or that you do actually have an Amiga, it's just very well hidden.

TODO
----

* Add floppy disk seeking sounds.

* Sync Uzebox power LED with floppy disk seeking sounds.
