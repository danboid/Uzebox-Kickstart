Uzebox Kickstart
================

Uzebox-Kickstart is arguably the ultimate fake retro computer emulator available for the Uzebox! It is more accurately an Amiga Kickstart screen simulator. You can run Uzebox-Kickstart on a Uzebox to fool your friends and family into thinking you've got an Amiga emulator on your Uzebox that you've just not configured properly yet or that you do actually have an Amiga, it's just very well hidden.
